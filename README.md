# Yankee online store application

## Description

Application for an online store of fashionable women's clothing. Implemented in TypeScript using React JS. It was assumed that in addition to the client part of the application, the server part would be emulated. Which would allow to have a demo version of the application without implementing the real server part. Development was stopped after the implementation of the server part due to circumstances beyond my control. The client part of the application is partially implemented.

## Stack
